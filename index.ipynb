        "Web scraping is a powerful tool since it allows to access vast amounts of publicly available data directly from websites, enabling original research that might otherwise be difficult to conduct. Through web scraping, researchers can collect diverse data types—such as social media posts, news articles, forum discussions, or product reviews—that offer insights into public opinion, behavior trends, cultural shifts, and social interactions. It allows to gather data frequently updated in real-time, capturing evolving conversations and events that may not be accessible through traditional datasets. Furthermore, web scraping enables tailored data collection, allowing researchers to focus on specific topics, keywords, or populations relevant to their studies, which can enhance the relevance and richness of social research. \n",

        "html_elements(\"h2.header\")\n",
        "```\n",

However, selecting the right elements without over (or under) selecting can be quite tricky. Luckily, there are tools that can help you to find the correct css selectors for specific elements.

To use it, simply open this page in a browser and then drag the following link to your bookmark bar [SelectorGadget](javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20s=document.createElement('div');s.innerHTML='Loading...';s.style.color='black';s.style.padding='20px';s.style.position='fixed';s.style.zIndex='9999';s.style.fontSize='3.0em';s.style.border='2px%20solid%20black';s.style.right='40px';s.style.top='40px';s.setAttribute('class','selector_gadget_loading');s.style.background='white';document.body.appendChild(s);s=document.createElement('script');s.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');s.setAttribute('src','https://dv0akt2986vzh.cloudfront.net/unstable/lib/selectorgadget.js');document.body.appendChild(s);%7D)();).

        "While web scraping is a valuable tool for data collection, it’s essential for researchers to approach it responsibly. Responsible web scraping helps ensure that data is collected ethically, legally, and in ways that protect both the integrity of the website and the privacy of individuals whose data may be included. If you are new to the topic, please do read our [GESIS DBD Guide](https://www.gesis.org/fileadmin/admin/Dateikatalog/pdf/guides/10_soldner_how_to_static_web_scraping.pdf) on the topic and consider these steps you can take to scrape responsibly:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Check the Website's Terms of Service**: Before scraping, always review the website's terms of service or usage policy. Many sites explicitly prohibit scraping, and respecting these terms is both legally and ethically important. If the website allows data collection for research purposes, proceed with caution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Respect Robots.txt and Use robots.txt Checker**: Most websites have a robots.txt file that specifies which parts of the site can or cannot be accessed by automated tools. Use robots.txt to guide your scraping efforts and avoid restricted areas of the site. The [robotstxt](https://docs.ropensci.org/robotstxt/) package can help automate this check.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Limit the Request Frequency**: Sending too many requests in a short time can overload a server, affecting the website's performance and possibly causing your IP to be blocked. To avoid this, add delays between requests using functions like `Sys.sleep()` as we did above. A delay of a few seconds per request is a good practice, especially for larger data extractions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scrape Only What You Need**: Focus on collecting only the data relevant to your research questions to minimize unnecessary scraping and data collection. Collecting excessive data can slow your analysis, increase storage needs, and raise ethical concerns around data hoarding.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Consider Alternative Data Sources**: If possible, use official APIs provided by a website. APIs are designed to give researchers and developers controlled access to data, reducing the likelihood of server strain and ensuring that data is collected within the website’s terms of service. Many platforms, like Twitter and Reddit, offer APIs for research purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "By considering these best practices, you can ensure that your web scraping activities are conducted responsibly, minimizing any potential harm to website owners, servers, and individuals involved in the data. The R package [polite](https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite/) can help to setup your scraping code politely\".\n",

        "- [rvest Documentation](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/): The package does not have many functions as we used in the tutorial, but the docs do provide some additional background.\n",
        "\n",
        "- As mentioned before, the R packages [polite](https://dmi3kno.github.io/polite/) and [robotstxt](https://docs.ropensci.org/robotstxt/) are extremely helpful to set up responsible scraping routines\n",
        "\n",
        "- `rvest` only allows to obtain data from static webpages. For retrieving data from dynamic pages, consider using the R package [RSelenium](https://docs.ropensci.org/RSelenium/)"
